# Video2Midi
Create midi output using a video file as parameters for pitch, volume and rhythm
Basically, the screen is divided into four quadrants to provide four discrete voices. The brighter the screen, the higher the pitch. This is done with the Version 8 of the MAX/MSP program from Cycling74 ( https://cycling74.com/ ). Many have used the program to use sound to create video images, but I am trying to reverse the process and create sound from video. This is similar to image sonification, used to create sound from data to help the vision-disabled to navigate their environment.
